The on_next method is a good starting point to get insight
https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY/blob/master/rx/subjects/subject.py#L78

A subject is observed by an observer.
The subject will "feed" observers new data points.
The data points are used by the observers satisfy their conditions.


Look in rx/linq/observable for the observeable list.

To understand how the observables are made available as methods, look
at the following code (from rx/linq/observable/windowwithcount):

@add_metaclass(ExtensionMethod)
class ObservableWindowWithCount(Observable):
    """Uses a meta class to extend Observable with the methods in this class"""

A little too much magic for me, but still very effective
